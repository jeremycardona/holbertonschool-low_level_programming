	basically, what is recursion.
-> self calling functions
 	how to implement recursions.
-> base case so the self calling function doesn't infinitely call.
	in what situations should you implemenet recursions.
-> problems that are solved iteratively can also be solved recursively.
	in what situations you shouldn't implement recursion
-> where function calls might overflow stack memory, causing the memory exceed capacity.
